## Description

After enabling this extension in Chrome, all New Tab pages are turned into a game of Google Brick Breaker! The bricks are letters of the keyboard, and the search bar is the paddle. When a brick is broken, the letter is added to the search query. If the ball falls, a google search is performed with whatever nonsense is in the search bar/paddle at the time.

### Installation
